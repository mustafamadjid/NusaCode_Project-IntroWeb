            The Adventure of Gozy Cat is a game created using python as
            programming language.In this game, players will control a character
            named Gozy. Gozy is a cat who got lost in a dangerous forest.
            Players must avoid several evil monsters and dangerous obstacles
            until Gozy returns to his master's house.
          </p>
          <p>
            Players can control Gozy Cat by using the 'W (Jump), A (Left), D
            (Right)' keys on the keyboard. These buttons will move Gozy
            according to directions to pass through each obstacle in the form of
            an Obstacle or Monster. The Gozy character's health only has 3
            hearts. If the player hits a monster or obstacle, health will be
            reduced by one heart. If health runs out, the player loses (Game
            Over). Players can win if they manage to finish at home.
